## Project Overview

### Overview

* **Tagline:** Empowering creators with on-chain tipping.

* **Description:** Praze is a platform where creators can earn DOT, KSM, and testnet tokens directly from their supporters. They can set up a custom profile, offer exclusive content, sell digital downloads, and run membershipsâ€”all powered by ink! smart contracts on Polkadot. With a clean interface and creator-first tools, Praze makes on-chain monetization easy, elegant, and built for the Polkadot ecosystem.

* **Relation to ink!:** All monetization logic (tipping, membership access, paywalls, downloadable content validation) will be built with ink! smart contracts deployed on a supported testnet and AssetHub.

* **Category:** Canary Dapp

* **Team's Motivation:** Weâ€™re passionate about enabling creators in the Polkadot ecosystem to succeed. We believe creators are underrepresented in on-chain tooling, and Praze helps them be rewarded in a way that feels native, elegant, and sustainable. The current landscape is dominated by generic tipping tools; Praze sets a new standard.

## Ink! Ecosystem Impact

* **Practical Use Case:** Praze will be one of the first full-featured creator monetization platforms built with ink!. It will demonstrate ink!'s power to go beyond infrastructure and deliver end-user value in elegant applications.

* **Showcase Potential:** We will document the smart contract design in a Medium post, open-source the contracts, and deploy them to Polkadot AssetHub and a testnet.

* **Ecosystem Benefit:** This project will:

  * Onboard more creators to Polkadot.
  * Showcase how ink! smart contracts can handle nuanced business logic like gated access and recurring memberships.
  * Serve as a boilerplate dapp reference for others building consumer-grade apps using ink!.

* **Business Case:** While not monetized via tokens, Praze introduces a sustainable model for creators to earn DOT/KSM directly and build their micro-economies, increasing token velocity in the ecosystem.
