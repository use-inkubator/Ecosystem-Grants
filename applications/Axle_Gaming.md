### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Please clearly describe how exactly your project will benefit the ecosystem. If it's infrastructure - how it's going to be applied and by who.

If it's technical showcase we would like you to demonstrate how ink! will be promoted using your results. 

If it's a business case we would like to see business model and future production plans. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
- Do you need an audit for the contacts? **YES/NO**
(don’t add it as part of Milestones! The auditor will be chosen among Auditor track participants)
- CATEGORY: Infrastructure OR Canary Dapp OR Technical Showcase
- An overview of the business model, including revenue streams, target market, and scalability, if applicable.
- Future production plans and growth strategy, highlighting how the project intends to achieve sustainability and long-term success, if applicable.


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application:

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the level of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality
