## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

Project Description:
Axle Gaming is creating a more impactful way of game distribution by creating a unified gamer identity that aggregates data from both Web2 game distribution channels (e.g., Steam, Epic Games, Xbox) and Web3 sources (e.g., wallets, NFTs, Game based transactions). This unified identity powers our AI agent, "Lorekeeper", built with ElizaOS and GOAT SDK which offers personalized quests, meaningful engagement insights to games and studios, and smart recommendations for games and in-game assets.​

Relation to ink! ecosystem:
We will bring real users with real data, mapped directly to ink! smart contracts. Our distribution layer can be leveraged by other infrastructure products, and Games build on the ecosystem. In return, we can integrate with ink!'s native projects like Aleph Zero and Phala Network, while bridging assets from other blockchains to the Axle marketplace, benefiting the entire ecosystem.

Chosen Project Idea Category: Canary Dapp
Explanation: As a Canary Dapp, Axle Gaming will serve as a pioneering application demonstrating the practical integration of ink! smart contracts in a real-world gaming context. This will showcase ink!'s potential in managing complex user identities and AI-driven interactions.​

Team Interest:
The team is passionate about creating a abstracted and engaging gaming ecosystem as we too are gamers. We aim to empower real gamers and provide developers with meaningful metrics and insights.​



### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Axle Gaming distribution network will deliver significant contributions to the ink!'s ecosystem by providing practical, real-world game based data.

Axle will be utilizing oracles and rollups as we bridge Web2 (e.g., Steam, Epic, Xbox preferences) and Web3 (NFTs, wallets) data over ink! smart contracts. Which other infrastructure/studios can leverage for their own dApps, games, marketplaces, or communities.

Real-World User Onboarding & Ecosystem Growth:
By attracting real users with real data, We will drive authentic user engagement within the ink! ecosystem. We will bring Games,Indi Developers to ink!'s ecosystem and its capabilities. Additionally, our multi-blockchain marketplace will bring a diverse set of assets (e.g., NFTs, in-game items) to ink!-powered platforms, enhancing liquidity and cross-chain interoperability.

In summary, Axle Gaming will not only benefit the ink! ecosystem by utilizing its smart contracts for complex data management but also help expand its user base, and contribute to the growth of ink!-based gaming.


### Project Details

Project Details
Data Models / API Specifications:

Gamer Identity Schema: Combining Web2 and Web3 data points to create a gamer profile.

​
Technology Stack:

Smart Contracts: ink! for managing identities, preferences, and reward logic.

AI Agent: ElizaOS powering "Lorekeeper" for personalized recommendations and GOAT SDK for reward distribution.

Data Aggregation: Oracles and rollups to fetch and verify data from external sources, For now we are storing the preferences on our centralized database. We would also be working with databanks like Turf and Helika to fetch gameplay data.

Frontend: Next.js for user interface.

Backend: Node.js with Express for API management.​

Proof of Concept / MVP:

A live questing platform is available at https://dev.axlegaming.xyz/, The agent is still in development.​

Audit Requirement: Yes

Category: Canary Dapp

Business Model Overview:

Revenue Streams: We’re earning through quest/event creation fees, marketplace transaction fees, premium subscriptions, and revenue sharing from community partnerships.

Target Market: Game developers and studios, Web2 gamers.

Scalability: Designed to support a growing number of games and users, with our architecture for easy integration of new features.​

Future Production Plans:

H1 2025: Launch of MVP with core features and initial integrations.

H2 2025: Expansion of Web2 onboarding tools, introduction of autonomous AI trading features, and development of comprehensive tools for game studios.

Beyond 2025: Continuous enhancement of AI capabilities, expansion of our distribution layer.​

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Bounty Program?** Personal recommendation.

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

Product Development: The product is almost ready, We are getting in data from distributors like Steam and Epic Games. Xbox and Play store are pending. Plus we are able to get in the data from wallets, just the recommendation part of the AI agent is pending. The reward distribution is also working both through the smart contract or through the AI Agent. Plus, we need to make few important changes in the UI/UX.

User Growth: We’ve accumulated 2,500+ waitlist registrations along with a few hundred users on Discord, Telegram, and growing social media channels.

Market Validation: Early LOIs with multiple game developers and positive validation from multiple gamers and ecosystems that were harmed by these bots and farmers. Will be creating list of these.
