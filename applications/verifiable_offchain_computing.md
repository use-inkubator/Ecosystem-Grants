## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

On-chain computation capabilities are inherently limited by blockchain design, which affects all smart contract platforms including ink!. Our project aims to complement ink! smart contracts by providing verifiable off-chain computing capabilities through Phala Cloud's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), enabling developers to build more complex applications while maintaining blockchain security guarantees.

This solution bridges the gap between blockchain's security and off-chain computational power through:

1. A Professional SDK Suite
   - Enterprise-ready toolkit for seamless smart contract integration
   - Built-in ACID compliance for reliable state management
   - Production-grade security with TEE protection

2. Production-Ready Oracle Suite
   - Price Feed Oracle: Real-time market data integration from CoinGecko
   - VRF Oracle: Cryptographically secure random number generation
   - Graph API Oracle: Universal indexer connectivity (SubQuery, Subsquid, The Graph, ...)

3. Next-Generation AI Integration (Future implementation, outside of this grant)
   - Full Eliza OS integration for advanced AI capabilities
   - Direct LLM connectivity through Phala Cloud
   - Interactive proof-of-concept with Tic-Tac-Toe game

Each component is designed with enterprise-grade reliability and seamless integration capabilities, deployed on Phala Cloud's secure computing platform.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Verifiable Offchain Computing is crucial for ink! smart contracts because it enables complex computations to be executed off-chain while ensuring their integrity and verifiability on-chain. Here's why it matters:

1. Interoperability with External Systems
   - Smart contracts often need to access external APIs, databases, and oracles.
   - Verifiable Offchain Computing ensures that off-chain data used in smart contracts is correct and tamper-proof.

2. Verifiable Computation
   - To ensure the integrity of off-chain computations, Remote Attestations are generated and Phala L2 Explorer tools simplify trustless verification.

3. Use Cases
   - Rollups: Off-chain execution with verification.
   - Oracles: Retrieve and verify off-chain data for smart contracts.
   - AI: Use AI/LLM in your ink! smart contracts

In summary, Verifiable Offchain Computing provides many benefits and use cases for dApps developed with ink! smart contracts.

### Project Details

#### SDK Details

The SDK will be designed to simplify the connection between smart contracts and dApps deployed on Phala Cloud. 
Its primary goal is to enable transactional and atomic cross-blockchain operations, ensuring seamless integration and interaction.

##### The Challenge
Developing dApps that interact with blockchains can be a common but challenging task, especially when it comes to handling concurrency issues in off-chain programs. 
Without a proper synchronization mechanism, this may end up conflicting between the contracts and dApp deployed on Phala Cloud.

Consider a real-world scenario: a smart contract distributes computation tasks to workers. These workers compete with each other when claiming tasks from the blockchain. Ideally, each task should only be claimed once. However, without coordination among the workers, they might send transactions simultaneously to claim the same task, resulting in inconsistent smart contract states.

Consistent state management is crucial when developing an application that communicates with a blockchain. Developers need a reliable and transactional way to perform operations, where read and write tasks are combined into a single unit and executed atomically on the blockchain. This approach aligns with the ACID principle found in transactional database management systems.

The sdk is here to simplify development by providing a stable, ACID-compliant connection with ink! smart contracts. This eliminates concurrency issues and enables a request-response programming model for seamless interaction between the workers and on-chain smart contracts.

##### Key Benefits
- Seamless connectivity between ink! smart contracts and workers
- Reliable KV-store on blockchains for durable state management
- Transactional (ACID) on-chain KV-store designed for stateful dApps deployed on Phala Cloud
- ACID-compliant read, write, and contract call operations for consistent data handling
- Request-response programming model that simplifies interactions between worker and on-chain smart contracts

##### Architectural Diagram

Ink! smart contracts, built with ink! v6, will be deployed on `pallet-revive` and an application, built on js/ts, will be deployed on Phala Cloud.

Websocket and http requests will be used to communicate between the ink! smart contracts and the application on Phala Cloud.

Our sdk will manage the synchronization mechanism and the developers would have a reliable and transactional way to perform operations, where read and write tasks are combined into a single unit and executed atomically on the blockchain.

The SDK will be divided into two parts:
- the client will be integrated as a Rust library within ink! smart contracts.
- the rollup will be integrated as a JavaScript library within applications deployed on Phala Cloud.

##### Note
In 2023, our team built the [Phala's offchain rollup anchor](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phat-offchain-rollup) implementation for ink! smart contracts in the context of Phala Builder.
Even if this sdk is still used in mainnet, it was built with ink! v4, OpenBrush and Phat Contracts. OpenBrush is now deprecated. Phat Contracts are replaced by Phala Cloud. 
The main goal is to provide the same features as [Phala's offchain rollup anchor](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phat-offchain-rollup) but with the latest technologies (ink! v6 and Phala Cloud compatibility)

##### Languages
The library/crate used in ink! smart contracts will be written in Rust and the latest released ink! version.
The library used in the worker deployed on Phala Cloud will be written in TypeScript and will use the latest version of Polkadot-API (PAPI).

#### Price Feed Oracle, VRF Oracle, Graph Api Oracle

In the previous cohort, we released the [decentralized oracles](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Ecosystem-Grants/blob/master/applications/decentralized_oracles.md) built with Phala's offchain rollup anchor.
We want to build the same oracles with the new SDK to ensure the robustness of the new SDK and provide concrete and functional usage examples.
- Price Feed Oracle. The Oracle will read the data from CoinGecko and feed the data in ink! smart contracts
- VRF Oracle. It will generate cryptographically secure random numbers for ink! smart contracts
- Graph API Oracle that: The Oracle will query a SubQuery/SubSquid endpoint and send the output to the ink! smart contract

For each oracle, we will provide:
- The worker to be deployed on Phala Cloud
- The ink! smart contracts to interact with the worker
- A UI to test and play with these smart contracts
- For the Graph API Oracle, we will index the data from the dApps Staking on Astar and return the information about the stakers
- The documentation to use these oracles

All smart contracts will be deployed on testnet.
The Price Feed Oracle will be deployed on Polkadot AssetHub. 
If there is a need for the community to deploy other oracles on Polkadot AssetHub, we will do it.
