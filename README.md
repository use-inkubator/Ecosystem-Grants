### üëã Introduction

Ecosystem Grants are part of the **ink!ubator**, a holistic bounty program with the goal of furthering the ink! smart contracting ecosystem. This bounty program is funded by the Polkadot treasury with the support of the community.

The bounty includes Curators from the following Polkadot ecosystem teams:

- [W3F](https://web3.foundation/)
- [Michi](https://github.com/cmichi)
- [Velocity Labs](https://www.velocitylabs.org/)
- [David Semakula](https://davidsemakula.com/)
- [R0GUE](https://r0gue.io/)
- **Facilitator**:
    - [Toma Sadova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toma-sadova/)

### Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. This program funds projects that are dedicated to ink! ecosystem growth. We focus on strong technical ideas that contribute to ink! infrastructure, demonstrate ink!'s potential, and unveil applicable business sides, thus growing the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have better chances of being accepted if:

- It clearly shows the advantage of ink! over other smart contract languages (e.g., Solidity).
- Your idea is innovative and contributes to the growth of Web3, Polkadot, and the ink! ecosystem. Innovation is preferred over duplicating existing EVM solutions.
- It presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, with some prior work to showcase.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, if applicable.
- Your team has **proven experience** with relevant languages, technologies, and/or a strong technical background. GitHub profiles of team members should be included in your application.
- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.

Additionally, all projects must fulfill the following requirements

- Your project uses the RISC-V compatible version of the ink! language, [v6.X releases](https://use.ink/6.x/). The current cohort is focused on funding developments willing to push the ecosystem forward by leveraging ink!'s stack in its most ecosystem-aligned version.
- All code produced must be **open-sourced**, without relying on closed-source software for full functionality. Preferred licenses include Apache 2.0, GPLv3, MIT, or Unlicense.
- Projects involved in token sales are not eligible.
- Applications must not mention a specific token. Instead, focus on the software being implemented/researched.
- Teams must finish an ongoing grant before applying for another one.
- We do not fund projects encouraging gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities.
- Communication:
  - After your grant application is approved, create a post on the Polkadot Forum. Post regular updates in that thread until the grant is finished.
  - If your project needs an ink! contract to work, deploy at least one example to Polkadot AssetHub and write a Medium post about how to use it.
  - At the end of the grant, write a Medium post on the project and a tutorial on how to use it.
  - Explore other means of making the project visible in the community.

All projects must include documentation explaining their functionality. At a minimum, **written documentation** is required.

We take licensing and proper attribution very seriously. Any misuse of others' work without proper credit will lead to immediate termination of the grant. If in doubt, reach out before submitting.

### Project Ideas

The main acceptance criteria for any submitted project is its impact on the ink! ecosystem. Suggested categories include:

**Business Dapp**

This category is for early-stage startups utilizing ink! that seek grant support. Applicants must demonstrate a viable business model, a capable team, and readiness to transform their idea into a functional company. A pitch deck is encouraged.

**Canary Dapp**

A Canary Dapp is a full-stack application that **could** be deployed on a value-bearing network but may not be fully production-ready. These projects serve as references for developers building production-grade dApps.

Examples:

- Lending application for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets.
- Liquid staking solutions issuing redeemable receipts for staked tokens.
- Aggregators uniting decentralized protocols and liquidity sources.

**Technical Showcase**

This category involves applications demonstrating ink!'s advantages over other smart contract languages, such as:

- Efficient gas usage
- Decreased contract size
- Improved developer and debugging experience

**Infrastructure**

This category focuses on improving the ink! ecosystem's developer infrastructure and tooling.

Examples of successful infrastructure products:

- Oracles (price feeds, VRF, customizable oracles, etc.)
- DAO tooling (smart contracts, SDKs, UIs)
- Bridges (XCM integration, external blockchain bridges)

### üìù Process

> üì¢ Payment is made in DOT (on Polkadot).

#### 1. Application

1. [Fork](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Ecosystem-Grants/fork) this repository.
2. Create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Ecosystem-Grants/blob/master/applications/application-template.md)).
3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
4. Complete the template with as much detail as possible.
5. Submit a pull request to this repository. Only include **one new file** in your pull request.

#### 2. Application Review

1. Curators will review and comment on your pull request.
2. Address feedback by modifying your application.
3. Once ready, the application will be marked as `ready for review` and shared with the committee.
4. Approval requires **4 votes** and will mark the project start date.

#### 3. Milestone Delivery and Payment
