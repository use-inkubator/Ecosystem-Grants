The bounty includes Curators from the following Polkadot ecosystem teams:

- [W3F](https://web3.foundation/)
- [Michi](https://github.com/cmichi)
- [Velocity Labs](https://www.velocitylabs.org/)
- [David Semakula](https://davidsemakula.com/)
- [R0GUE](https://r0gue.io/)
- **Facilitator**:
    - [Toma Sadova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toma-sadova/)

### Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. This program funds projects that are dedicated to ink! ecosystem growth. We focus on strong technical ideas that contribute to ink! infrastructure, demonstrate ink!'s potential, and unveil applicable business sides, thus growing the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have better chances of being accepted if:

- It clearly shows the advantage of ink! over other smart contract languages (e.g., Solidity).
- Your idea is innovative and contributes to the growth of Web3, Polkadot, and the ink! ecosystem. Innovation is preferred over duplicating existing EVM solutions.
- It presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, with some prior work to showcase.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, if applicable.
- Your team has **proven experience** with relevant languages, technologies, and/or a strong technical background. GitHub profiles of team members should be included in your application.
- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.

Additionally, all projects must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced must be **open-sourced**, without relying on closed-source software for full functionality. Preferred licenses include Apache 2.0, GPLv3, MIT, or Unlicense.
- Projects involved in token sales are not eligible.
- Applications must not mention a specific token. Instead, focus on the software being implemented/researched.
- Teams must finish an ongoing grant before applying for another one.
- We do not fund projects encouraging gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities.

All projects must include documentation explaining their functionality. At a minimum, **written documentation** is required.

We take licensing and proper attribution very seriously. Any misuse of others' work without proper credit will lead to immediate termination of the grant. If in doubt, reach out before submitting.

### Project Ideas

The main acceptance criteria for any submitted project is its impact on the ink! ecosystem. Suggested categories include:

**Business Dapp**

This category is for early-stage startups utilizing ink! that seek grant support. Applicants must demonstrate a viable business model, a capable team, and readiness to transform their idea into a functional company. A pitch deck is encouraged.

**Canary Dapp**

A Canary Dapp is a full-stack application that **could** be deployed on a value-bearing network but may not be fully production-ready. These projects serve as references for developers building production-grade dApps.

Examples:

- Lending application for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets.
- Liquid staking solutions issuing redeemable receipts for staked tokens.
- Aggregators uniting decentralized protocols and liquidity sources.

**Technical Showcase**

This category involves applications demonstrating ink!'s advantages over other smart contract languages, such as:

- Efficient gas usage
- Decreased contract size
- Improved developer and debugging experience

**Infrastructure**

This category focuses on improving the ink! ecosystem's developer infrastructure and tooling.

Examples of successful infrastructure products:

- Oracles (price feeds, VRF, customizable oracles, etc.)
- DAO tooling (smart contracts, SDKs, UIs)
- Bridges (XCM integration, external blockchain bridges)
